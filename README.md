## About ##
* This is a very interesting single-player memory game built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
* It has total 20 levels and you win when you complete all 20 levels.
* Basically in this game, you have to memorize the color combinations randomly generated by program and input the color by clicking it in the same order as generated and thus you clear the level.
* Each time when a player presses the color button or when the color button is selected by program, sound and "light up" animation is produced. 
* The score gets updated as you keep on clearing the level.


**This is a very addictive game and you are definitely gonna love this!!**
